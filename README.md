Send notifications who leaves or enters home by cellphones, laptops etc.

## Posible better ways.

1: Someone has found a better way to detect iphones but my coding skills suck to translate this C# code to python. [HERE](http://www.power-home.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=3250)

2: Thought on doing also some `tcpdump` to check if a device is sending stuff like discovery services etc. So it aways listens.

3: Might be better if we had control over the router/modem, DD-WRT, relay all traffic to the pi idk.


## Setup

REQUIREMENTS:`nmap`, python3.


1) Register in http://www.pushetta.com.

2) Create a channel in pushetta and grab your api key from the dashboard.

3) Paste the api key and channel name in the `config.py` file.

4) Do `sudo pip3 install pushetta`

5) Install pusheta in your phone

6) Subscribe to your channel in the app

7) Use `nmap` or Fing (android app) to determine the MAC adresses of the devices you wanna keep track.

8) Add those MAC adresses to `ids.csv` file with the format `MACADDRESS,NAMEDEVICE`

9) Script must run as root, or `sudo`.(i think `nmap` requires this)

10) To start at boot add this line `python3 /home/pi/ph/ph.py &` to `/etc/rc.local` in the line before exit 0.


## How it Works

Takes `ids,csv` creates a list of of booleans wherever a device is detected, every 60 seconds it appends.

*pseudocode*

12:23:DE,[True ,False,True ]
23:EF:43,[False,False,False]

Then it creates a conclusion, the conclusion is if the the device has been seen at least once during the cycle,. after 10~ cycles the conclusion is created and the cycle stopped.

12:23:DE,[True ,False,True ,.....] -> 12:23:DE,True
23:EF:43,[False,False,False,.....] -> 23:EF:43,False

Then it begins another cycle. For another 10~ itinerations, and creates another conclusion.

12:23:DE,[False,False,True,....] -> 12:23:DE,True
23:EF:43,[True ,True ,True,....] -> 23:EF:43,True

Then it compares conclusions. And looks for change so.

False then False : device is not present dont send notification
True  then True  : device is present dont send notification
False then True  : device was not present, then is present so send notification is has arrived
True  then False : devces was present, then is not present so send notification is has left
